# Space Mad Libs Game

## Overview

Space Mad Libs is a fun and engaging game that allows players to create their own wacky space adventure stories! The game is built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS and does not rely on any external libraries. It utilises form inputs and event listeners to handle user interactions.

## How To Play

1. Select the type of expedition you'd like to embark on.
2. Fill in the provided fields with suitable words.
3. Click "Generate Story" and enjoy your own unique space adventure!
   
## Game Rules

The game rules are simple. Just fill in the fields with the appropriate type of word (noun, verb, adjective, etc.). The game is challenging and engaging because it tests the player's creativity and knowledge of parts of speech.

## Development Process

Developing this project was a fantastic exercise in problem-solving. Some of the notable challenges faced during the development included:

1. **Image Sourcing and Usage**: Finding copyright-free images that fit the theme of the game was a task. Then, using CSS to place these images as backgrounds and controlling their position was a significant learning curve.

2. **CSS Padding and Shadows**: It took quite a bit of research and experimentation to master these CSS properties. I learned how to create the desired aesthetic and user-friendly interface by adding padding to space out elements and box shadows to provide depth.

3. **Font Selection**: Choosing the right font to complement the game's theme and ensure readability was another challenge.

4. **JavaScript Logic**: Implementing JavaScript logic to dynamically create the story based on user input was complex. It required a good understanding of event listeners and manipulating DOM elements.
